AIM

To write an assembly language program in 8051 to generate a 2 ms delay using Timer 0 in Mode 1 and toggle an LED connected to Port 2.0.

APPARATUS REQUIRED

Personal  computer

ALGORITHM:

Start the program.

Initialize Port 2 as output by loading 00H into P2.

Set Timer 0 in Mode 1 (16-bit timer mode) by loading TMOD with 01H.

Load the timer registers:

TH0 = F8H

TL0 = 30H
(This gives approximately 2 ms delay for a 12 MHz crystal.)

Start Timer 0 by setting the TR0 bit.

Wait until the Timer Overflow Flag (TF0) becomes 1 (indicating the delay period is complete).

Stop Timer 0 by clearing the TR0 bit.

Clear the overflow flag TF0 to prepare for the next delay cycle.

Toggle the LED connected to Port 2.0 using CPL P2.0.

Repeat steps 4â€“9 continuously to keep toggling the LED.

End the program.

PROGRAM:

     ORG 0000H
    START:
    MOV P2, #00H        
    MOV TMOD, #01H      
    MAIN:
    MOV TH0, #0F8H      
    MOV TL0, #30H       
    SETB TR0            
    WAIT:
    JNB TF0, WAIT       
    CLR TR0             
    CLR TF0             
    CPL P2.0            
    SJMP MAIN           
    END

RESULT:
Thus the assembly language program in 8051 to generate a 2 ms delay using Timer 0 in Mode 1 and toggle an LED connected to Port 2.0 was executed successfully using keil and proteus
